    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

    <h3>
        Welcome to my official Data portfolio page. This page will contain all my cool projects that i have worked on in thw last year.
    </h3>

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->
    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>Project 1: UK/EU import PUR apps </h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I created an UK/EU import PUR App (to do what?)
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure id="Location1"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="chart-description"> <!-- we are grouping the title and description together so we can style them together -->
            <h2>Section 2: Another Chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is a more advanced chart. We'll cover charts like this in more detail later today.

        vegaEmbed('#Location5', figure_5_spec)

        // Do you want to add more graphs?
        // try defining a new variable for figure_3_spec, adding VegaEmbed for Location3, and adding a new section in the HTML
        // e.g. 
        // var figure_3_spec = ...
        // vegaEmbed('#Location3', figure_3_spec)
