    <h3>
        Hello and Welcome to my official Data portfolio page!
        I am Louise Anokye, an economist by profession with a strong passion for data science. My journey in economics has provided me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data-driven decision-making. 
        Now, I am excited to leverage these skills as I transition into the dynamic field of data science.

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->

            <h2>Project 1: UK/EU import PUR apps </h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Although the UK and EU have agreed tariff-free, quota-free access under the TCA, this only applies where the goods meet the relevant Rules of Origin and therefore not all trade between the two parties will qualify for zero tariffs. Understanding where preferences are being used (and where they are not), through Preference Utilisation Rate data can inform HMG’s efforts to increase trade and inform the work to revisit the TCA. The EU & UK Import Preference Utilisation Rate app allows users to explore the extent to which EU preferences are being used on imports from the UK, by presenting information on the tariff regime under which imports entered compared to the preferences for which they were eligible.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The UK Business Details app plots the names and addresses of UK importers and exporters trading products with non-EU countries and GB importers and exporters trading products with EU countries in 2022 and 2023 onto a map. It aims to help support analysis on tariffs and Rules of Origin by identifying which businesses trade which product (which may help with supply chain analysis) and where these businesses are located in the UK (which may help with regional analysis). You can explore the map to identify individual businesses and click on the red/blue dots find out the business name, sector, which codes they traded in and when. See the ‘Overview’ page for a list of caveats and important information.
