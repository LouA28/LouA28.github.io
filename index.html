        Welcome to my official Data portfolio page! <br>
    </h4>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">
        I am Louise Anokye, an economist by profession with a strong passion for data science. My journey in economics has provided me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data-driven decision-making.
        Now, I am excited to leverage these skills as I transition into the dynamic field of data science.
    </h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">
        Over the past few years, I have been expanding my expertise beyond traditional economics, diving into the world of data analysis, data visualisation, and statistical modeling.
        This portfolio is a reflection of that journey— a collection of projects where I’ve applied my skills to solve real-world problems, uncover insights, and build predictive models.

                The UK Business Details app plots the names and addresses of UK importers and exporters trading products with non-EU countries and GB importers and exporters trading products with EU countries in 2022 and 2023 onto a map. It aims to help support analysis on tariffs and Rules of Origin by identifying which businesses trade which product (which may help with supply chain analysis) and where these businesses are located in the UK (which may help with regional analysis). You can explore the map to identify individual businesses and click on the red/blue dots find out the business name, sector, which codes they traded in and when. See the ‘Overview’ page for a list of caveats and important information.
