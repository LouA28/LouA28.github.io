        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This econometrics project explores the determinants of <strong>Preference Utilisation Rates (PUR)</strong> under the 
            <strong>UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)</strong>. Preference utilisation is a key metric in trade policy, indicating how 
            effectively firms are taking advantage of zero-tariff provisions under the TCA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core research question is: <em>“What are the relative effects of tariff margins, Rules of Origin (RoO), and trade scale on PUR between the UK and EU?”</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Econometric Strategy</h2>
        <p>
            Guided by established literature—particularly Nilsson (2015) and Ayele et al. (2023)—the determinants of PUR are grouped into three key effects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Margin Effect:</strong> The incentive created by tariff differentials between MFN and preferential rates.</li>
            <li><strong>RoO Effect:</strong> The restrictiveness or complexity of the rules firms must meet to qualify for preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale Effect:</strong> The size of trade flows, which can affect firms' ability to absorb compliance costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I ran two model specifications using Python (in Visual Studio Code):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> A standard <strong>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</strong> model</li>
            <li> A <strong>Fractional Logit Model</strong>—appropriate for a dependent variable bounded between 0 and 1</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Tools and Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Software:</strong> Python, VS Code, Overleaf (for academic write-up)</li>
            <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> <code>statsmodels</code>, <code>pandas</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, <code>linearmodels</code></li>
            <li><strong>Data Prep:</strong> Feature engineering to derive log-scale variables, create dummy variables for HS codes and countries, and normalize restrictiveness indices.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Diagnostics:</strong> Residual plots, heteroskedasticity checks, and sensitivity testing (e.g., excluding outliers, log-transforms)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>preferential margin</strong> had a statistically significant positive effect on PUR—suggesting tariff incentives matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Restrictiveness of Rules of Origin</strong> negatively impacted PUR, particularly in sensitive agricultural sectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Trade scale (log of preferential imports)</strong> correlated positively with PUR, supporting economies of scale in compliance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These results align with broader literature and provide actionable insights into the barriers and incentives that shape trade behaviour under free trade agreements.
