               The UK Business Details app plots the names and addresses of UK importers and exporters trading products with non-EU countries and GB importers and exporters trading products with EU countries in 2022 and 2023 onto a map. It aims to help support analysis on tariffs and Rules of Origin by identifying which businesses trade which product (which may help with supply chain analysis) and where these businesses are located in the UK (which may help with regional analysis). You can explore the map to identify individual businesses and click on the red/blue dots find out the business name, sector, which codes they traded in and when.
