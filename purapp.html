        Welcome to my official Data portfolio page! <br>
    </h4>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">
        I am Louise Anokye, an economist by profession with a strong passion for data science. My journey in economics has provided me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data-driven decision-making.
        Now, I am excited to leverage these skills as I transition into the dynamic field of data science.

    <h3 style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px;">
        Over the past few years, I have been expanding my expertise beyond traditional economics, diving into the world of data analysis, data visualisation, and statistical modeling.
        This portfolio is a reflection of that journey— a collection of projects where I’ve applied my skills to solve real-world problems, uncover insights, and build predictive models.
