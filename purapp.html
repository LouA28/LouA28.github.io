            <h2>Project 1: UK/EU PUR App</h2>
            <p>
            Although the UK and EU have agreed tariff-free, quota-free access under the TCA, this only applies where the goods meet the relevant Rules of Origin and therefore not all trade between the two parties will qualify for zero tariffs. Understanding where preferences are being used (and where they are not), through Preference Utilisation Rate data can inform HMGâ€™s efforts to increase trade and inform the work to revisit the TCA.
           </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>EU & UK Import Preference Utilisation Rate App</strong> is an interactive data dashboard that analyzes <strong>UK import preference utilization rates (PUR)</strong>, helping policymakers and businesses understand the impact of <strong>Rules of Origin</strong> under the <strong>Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I developed this application using <strong>R and Shiny</strong>, integrating automated data processing, interactive visualizations, and statistical analysis to track how tariff preferences are used over time.

            <h3>Key Data Science Elements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Processing & Wrangling:</strong> Cleaned, transformed, and structured UK import data using <code>dplyr</code>, <code>tidyverse</code>, and <code>data.table</code> for efficient querying and filtering.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Data Pipeline:</strong> Developed scripts to <strong>automate data extraction, transformation, and updating</strong> for real-time accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-Series Analysis & Visualization:</strong> Built <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>plotly</code>-powered graphs to analyze PUR trends by <strong>HS section</strong> and <strong>partner country</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive & Scalable Dashboards:</strong> Designed <strong>dynamic dashboards</strong> with country-specific filtering and user input capabilities using <code>Shiny</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Geospatial Mapping:</strong> Implemented <code>leaflet</code> and <code>sf</code> to visualize preference utilization across regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Used <strong>reactive programming</strong> in Shiny to ensure the app efficiently handles large datasets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact & Skills Demonstrated:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> The app enables policymakers to identify underutilized trade preferences, supporting evidence-based trade policy.</li>
                <li><strong>End-to-End Data Science Workflow:</strong> Showcases expertise in <strong>data engineering, visualization, and interactive analytics</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Problem-Solving:</strong> Addressed challenges in <strong>handling missing data, optimizing dashboard speed, and structuring high-dimensional trade data</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
