    <h2>EU & UK Import Preference Utilisation Rate App</h2>
    
    <p>
        The UK and EU have agreed on <strong>tariff-free, quota-free access</strong> under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), 
        but this only applies when goods meet the <strong>Rules of Origin</strong>. As a result, not all trade qualifies for zero tariffs. 
        Understanding where preferences are being used—and where they are not—through <strong>Preference Utilisation Rate (PUR) data</strong> 
        helps inform HMG’s efforts to increase trade and refine the TCA.
    </p>

    <p>
        This interactive data dashboard <strong>analyzes UK import preference utilization rates</strong>, 
        enabling policymakers and businesses to assess the impact of Rules of Origin under the TCA.
    </p>

    <p>
        I developed this application using <strong>R and Shiny</strong>, integrating automated data processing, 
        interactive visualizations, and statistical analysis to track how tariff preferences are used over time. 
        The app reveals that <strong>overall PUR rates for agricultural products are significantly high</strong> 
        and allows users to <strong>download customized reports</strong> based on their selected filters.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Data Science Elements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Processing & Wrangling:</strong> Cleaned, transformed, and structured UK import data using <code>dplyr</code>, <code>tidyverse</code>, and <code>data.table</code> for efficient querying and filtering.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Data Pipeline:</strong> Developed scripts to automate data extraction, transformation, and updating for real-time accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-Series Analysis & Visualization:</strong> Built <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>plotly</code>-powered graphs to analyze PUR trends by <strong>HS section</strong> and <strong>partner country</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive & Scalable Dashboards:</strong> Designed dynamic dashboards with <strong>country-specific filtering</strong>, user input capabilities, and <strong>downloadable reports</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Geospatial Mapping:</strong> Implemented <code>leaflet</code> and <code>sf</code> to visualize preference utilization across regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Used <strong>reactive programming</strong> in Shiny to ensure the app efficiently handles large datasets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact & Skills Demonstrated:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-World Trade Insights:</strong> The app highlights that <strong>agricultural products have significantly high PUR rates</strong>, helping policymakers assess trade trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Enables policymakers to <strong>identify underutilized trade preferences</strong> and refine trade policy accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>End-to-End Data Science Workflow:</strong> Showcases expertise in <strong>data engineering, visualization, automation, and interactive analytics</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Problem-Solving:</strong> Tackled challenges in handling <strong>missing data, optimizing dashboard speed, and structuring high-dimensional trade data</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
