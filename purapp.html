                Although the UK and EU have agreed tariff-free, quota-free access under the TCA, this only applies where the goods meet the relevant Rules of Origin and therefore not all trade between the two parties will qualify for zero tariffs. Understanding where preferences are being used (and where they are not), through Preference Utilisation Rate data can inform HMGâ€™s efforts to increase trade and inform the work to revisit the TCA. The EU & UK Import Preference Utilisation Rate app allows users to explore the extent to which EU preferences are being used on imports from the UK, by presenting information on the tariff regime under which imports entered compared to the preferences for which they were eligible.
